<h2>Who we are and what we do</h2>

<p class="left">Skryne Hill Preschool is a beautiful, purpose-built preschool located in an idyllic rural setting on the historic Hill of Skryne which opened in September 2015. We aim to actively promote the holistic development of children by providing a safe, secure and developmentally appropriate environment. Our preschool is a spacious and bright room with double doors that open out into our outdoor space to encourage the children to take an interest in the world outside. Our fully enclosed large outdoor natural play area is used by children daily as part of their play and learning development. The environments within the preschool invite children to explore and to see a world of possibilities that are within their reach.</p>

<div class="aboutimg right" id="aboutsection1"><img src="images/elfbutterfly.png" width="150" height="100" alt=""/> </div>
<p class="left"> We provide a developmentally appropriate, child-led emergent curriculum, both indoors and outdoors, through inspiring resources and experiences. Our curriculum supports children’s Well-being, Identity & Belonging, Communication, and Exploring & Thinking following Aistear, Ireland’s Early Childhood Curriculum Framework. Our older children are encouraged to get “Ready for School” so they can approach school with self-help skills and confidence that will enable them to succeed.</p>
